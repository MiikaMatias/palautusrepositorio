# Retrospektiivitekniikat

## Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel
Discussion formed in a five section wheel. Ask any of the five relevant questions defined in the title. Led by a facilitator. People can also write their comments up on posters, going around in groups. Every group then rotates through the posters, discussing the topic defined in them


## Glad, Sad, Mad
Broad-covering retrospective with length up to 60 minutes. Team members briefly write up their thoughts about the sprint, notes containing good or bad stuff. Each card is placed on a Glad, Sad, Mad whiteboard. Off topic issues, really anything is encouraged. Cards are grouped by a single individual according to the thing they refer to. All participants then discuss the issues even further, order based on f.e. a vote. Scrum master leads the discussion on issues.
